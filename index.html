    <p> Hey there! My name is Hamdalat. I am twenty years old. I will actually clock 21 in April.
    I am a lover of all things colourful and sweet-smelling. I love electronics.
    It is a newly found love, though, but I am enjoying every bit of the relationship. 
    I took up the Basic Coding Challenge because I believe acquiring new skills 
    gives your mind some sort of liberation. This, i guess, is another newly found love
    and even though it seems a bit difficult, I am loving it too.
          I am currently studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering in UI. 
    I am actually taking the BCC alongside my younger brother.
    He seems to have surpassed me and that in itself is a great joy. 
    I am always motivated by other people's success. I have this particular friend, 
    that actually has me to celebrate other people's successes.</p>
